This code is at an earlier stage than our previous conversation, so I don't want to give comments that are too detailed since I know your work has progressed since then and many of the issues I might raise have been taken care of. I still think you have the opportunity to include the allergy checks that you mentioned earlier, and we can talk in person about how that might happen. Briefly, however, consider prompting the user for allergies, storing those allergies in a list and then checking for them in your function.
