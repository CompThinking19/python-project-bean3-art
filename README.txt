  The project that I chose to do was a meal generator that would give healthy
food choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack. The reason I chose to do my
python project on this is because there is an obesity epidemic in the U.S.
However there is a misconception that the U.S. is worse off than other countries,
but incidences of Type 2 diabetes is higher in China and India. I have taken quite
a few classes in health and nutrition and the topic of health is very interesting
and important to me. Unfortunately, if we keep going at the rate that we are, our
children's lifespans will be shorter than ours. So healthy eating is very
important.
  When I first started this project, it was no too difficult. I had to work off
my own knowledge and use the Harvard Healthy Eating pyramid as a resource of what
is considered healthy. I created dictionaries of breakfast, lunch, dinner, and
snack consisting of these suggestions. For me that was the easy part. Through your
suggestion I imported random, but I just could not figure out how to use it. Once
you had a lesson on it, it was a little easier to figure out but I was still having
trouble because I was looking up how to take random items from a dictionary. With
your help, I learned I was taking it from a list. Once that was done, the rest
of the code was a little easier to figure out. My code is definitely not as
complicated as some others might be, but it is doing what I want it to which I
am very happy about.
