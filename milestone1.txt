You have a solid conceptual start here: you took the time to get your data into the program, and have a start at working with it in a function, which feels like it's a bout 3/4 complete at this point since the strings of individual meals are not being created yet, but the mechanism to do so is in place. Look at the return statement in your comment on the function: you say a meal is returned, but you don't yet give a sense of the type being returned or anything like that. This is a sign that you need to think a bit more carefully about what this function is doing. Your next steps here are to finish the existing function and then to figure out where it might fit in the larger scheme of the program.
